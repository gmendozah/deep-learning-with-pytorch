## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `deep-learning-with-pytorch/` (that contains this README) and run the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook your_jupyter_notebook.ipynb
```

or
```bash
jupyter notebook your_jupyter_notebook.ipynb
```

on any Jupyter Notebook.
This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
